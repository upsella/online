While reviews on platforms like Yelp can certainly be helpful, relying on them alone is not a sustainable long-term strategy. The right approach is to embrace the internet and take control of your online impression with a custom business website.</p><p>One of the most effective ways to control your online impression and drive sales is to have a custom business website. A website allows you to showcase your brand and products or services in a way that is tailored specifically to your business. It also gives you the opportunity to connect with potential customers through forms, email newsletters, and social media integration.</p><h2 id=big-goals>Big Goals</h2><p>To ensure that your website is low maintenance, cost-effective, and flexible, it&rsquo;s important to choose the right technology. One option that has gained popularity in recent years is the JAMstack approach, which utilizes static site generators such as Hugo and hosting platforms like Netlify.</p><p>Upsella is an excellent option for getting up and running with a custom business website. By utilizing JAMstack technology like Hugo and Netlify, you can build a website that is low maintenance, almost free to host, and highly customizable to showcase your brand. In addition to being low maintenance and cost-effective, JAMstack websites also offer excellent performance, the ability to update when and where you want, full SEO support, and a quick start.</p><h2 id=technology>Technology</h2><p>To ensure that your website is low maintenance, cost-effective, and flexible, it&rsquo;s important to choose the right technology. One option that has gained popularity in recent years is the JAMstack approach, which utilizes static site generators like Hugo and hosting platforms like Netlify. JAMstack websites offer a number of benefits for small businesses. They are extremely low maintenance, as the majority of the work is done upfront and there is no need for a traditional back-end server. This means you can focus on running your business instead of constantly updating and maintaining your website. In addition to being low maintenance, JAMstack websites are also very cost-effective. Hosting is almost free and there is no need to pay for expensive server infrastructure. This can be a major advantage for small businesses on a tight budget.</p><p>JAMstack websites are also extremely flexible and customizable. You can use templates and themes to quickly get up and running, or you can customize your site to perfectly match your brand. Additionally, with the use of modern technologies like React and GraphQL, you can build dynamic and interactive features that can help to engage and retain your customers.</p><p>Finally, JAMstack websites offer excellent performance, full SEO support, and the ability to update your site when and where you want. This can be a major advantage for small businesses that need to move quickly and adapt to changing market conditions.</p><p>There are numerous examples of small businesses that have seen increased revenues and brought in new customers through their online presence. For example, a small bakery was able to significantly increase sales by launching an e-commerce website and utilizing social media to promote their products. Another small business, a clothing boutique, was able to expand its customer base by creating a website and utilizing email marketing to promote sales and special offers.</p><p>One of the major benefits of modern website building technologies like Hugo is that they allow you to create a professional-quality website at a fraction of the cost compared to older technologies like Wordpress. This can be a major advantage for small businesses with limited budgets.</p><h2 id=online-payments>Online Payments</h2><p>In addition to having a custom business website, it&rsquo;s also important for small businesses to consider offering online payment options. By accepting payments online, you can provide convenience and security for your customers, which can help to increase sales and customer satisfaction.</p><p>There are a number of options for accepting payments online, including payment gateways like PayPal, Stripe, and Square. These services allow you to easily process credit card transactions on your website, as well as provide additional features like invoicing, recurring billing, and integrations with popular e-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce. In addition to payment gateways, you can also consider offering alternative payment options like Apple Pay and Google Pay. These options allow customers to make purchases with a simple tap on their smartphone, making the checkout process even faster and more convenient.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also important to consider the security of your online payment system. Customers are more likely to make a purchase if they feel confident that their personal and financial information is safe. Make sure to use a secure payment gateway and encrypt sensitive data on your website to protect your customers&rsquo; information.</p><p>In conclusion, a custom business website is an essential part of any small business&rsquo;s online marketing strategy. By utilizing technologies like Hugo and Netlify, you can create a low-maintenance, cost-effective website that showcases your brand and connects with potential customers. The right online presence can significantly increase your sales and margins, and bring in new customers.</p></div><div id=comments><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//Upsella.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div></div><div class=col-md-3></div></div></div></div><footer id=footer><div class=container><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6"><h4>About us</h4><p>UpSella is San Diego based web design agency that creates and markets online websites for your business at lower prices and with better sales results than other organizations.</p><hr class="hidden-md hidden-lg hidden-sm"></div><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6"></div><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6"><h4>SITE MAP</h4><hr class="hidden-md hidden-lg hidden-sm"><a href=/blog>Blog</a><br><a href=/about-us>About Us</a><br><a href=/terms-and-conditions>Terms and Conditions</a></div></div></footer><div id=copyright><div class=container><div class=col-md-12><p class=pull-left>Copyright (c) 2019 - 2022, Upsella; all rights reserved.</p></div></div></div></div><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-143BS8MZXN"></script>
