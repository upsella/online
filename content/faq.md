## 1. Our Business

UpSella is a business that was created by professionals who have a passion for creative design with website building. Our mission is to help the small businesses that do not have an online website or the large funds to build one and market online. One of the main reasons behind this issue is that requesting professionally built websites is normally very expensive, along with online marketing. It ends up not being affordable for many small businesses, which results in a huge loss of potential customers and sales. UpSella is the solution for companies without large funding, as we create affordable websites and online marketing.
