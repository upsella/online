## 1. Our Business

This business named UpSella is a business I created for a few reasons, one being that I have always wanted to go into online sales and marketing and I have always had a passion for creative design with website building. Another being that I found an issue that I believe I can solve... so many businesses do not market online and do not have an online website. One of the main reasons behind this issue is because requesting websites created professionally is normally very expensive, along with online marketing it ends up not being affordable for many businesses. That way there ends up being a huge loss of potential customers and sales for these businesses. So for that reason I decided to create UpSella. 

## 2. What We do

We set up online marketing and create websites for your business. Then websites we design are made by picking a template of your choice then downloading it into a code editor. After that we code the rest of your website with just the code editor. Lastly we pick a domain for your website and launch it on the web, then we refresh your domain every year to make sure your site keeps running. We also offer online marketing options such as setting up PPC advertising and SEO on your website to market your business and get it known. 

## 3. Web Design

We create online websites to your liking for a reasonable price, we will provide you many options for how you want your website to turn out and we will only charge you based on how you pick those options. We will make sure to make your website to your liking and if it is not then you can contact us and we would recreate it free of charge. 

## 4. Online Marketing

We can set up and run PPC advertising for you on the optimal platforms that will get it attention as a charge of $150 to $500 depending on the amount of platforms you want your advertisement to be displayed on.
